# Wordpress_Editors_Controler
The client requested to dynamically post the list of the Editors based on
the last name in alphabetical order. So I suggested an option to make
the list also manually ordered.

To make it user-friendly, I placed a controller, so the user can easily 
arrange the editors as it's necessary.


# Auto Mode (Last name in alpabetic order)

# Manual Mode (Manually place a number to indicate the order)
